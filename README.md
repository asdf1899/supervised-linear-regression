# Supervised Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is finding the best relationship between the input variable x (independent variable) and the expected variable y (dependent variable). 
The linear relationship between these two variables can be represented by a straight line called regression line.

The variable y is linearly dependent on the variable x. So, we can find a straight line which can best define the data.

This model could be applied to these following situations:
* Body mass vs Muscle strength
* Money spent on advertising vs Total sales
* Years of experience vs Salary
* Physical exercise (in mins) vs Cholesterol level
