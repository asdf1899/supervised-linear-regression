# Supervised Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is finding the best relationship between the input variable x (independent variable) and the expected variable y (dependent variable). 
The linear relationship between these two variables can be represented by a straight line called regression line.

The variable y is linearly dependent on the variable x. So, we can find a straight line which can best define the data.

This model could be applied to these following situations:
* Body mass vs muscle strength
* Money spent on advertising vs total sales
* Years of experience vs salary
* Physical exercise (in mins) vs cholesterol level

ecc...

## OLS

To calculate the regression line you can use the Ordinary Least Squares regression (metodo dei minimi quadrati):

## Example

_Y(predict value)=a(0.135)+b(0.627)*X(UserInput)_
